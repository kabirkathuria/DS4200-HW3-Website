        <h3>LeStat</h3>
        <p>Developed <strong>LeStat</strong>, an interactive basketball stats iOS application using Swift as a Software Developer when I was involved with Oasis. These are some key highlights from the project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built an interactive basketball stats iOS app with ESPN API integration to dynamically retrieve and display real-time NBA player data.</li>
            <li>Designed a tab-based user interface with a searchable and filterable player list, applying async/await for efficient data fetching.</li>
            <li>Architected a comprehensive sitemap, outlining core app functionalities, navigational page paths, and strategic calls to action based on user behavior.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Maze Solver</h3>
        <p>Built a <strong>Maze Solver Game</strong> using Java in my Fundies 2 coursework. I created a program which generates randomized animated mazes, and solves them automatically using depth-first and breadth-first search. These are some key highlights from the project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leveraged Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm and Union/Find for randomized animated maze generation; deployed game on AWS EC2 instance.</li>
            <li>Enabled breadth-first and depth-first search for automated maze-solving, and a manual traversal option utilizing keyboard controls.</li>
            <li>Integrated directional bias feature for tailored maze generation, and automatically showcased the solution path upon completion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>MovieLens Movie Recommendation System</h3>
        <p>Created a <strong>Movie Recommendation System Engine</strong> for my capstone project in the HarvardX: Data Science Professional Certificate Program. In this project, I refined a machine learning algorithm for a recommendation system tasked to predict movie ratings based on user preferences. These are some key highlights from the project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wrangled and tidied a 10M MovieLens dataset to build a movie recommendation engine that predicts trends in user movie ratings.</li>
            <li>Trained mean movie rating, movie effect, and user impact ML models and evaluated their accuracy using a validation set.</li>
            <li>Enhanced recommendation performance based on user preferences, minimizing the Root Mean Squared Error score to 0.864.</li>
        </ul>
