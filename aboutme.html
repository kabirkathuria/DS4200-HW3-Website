        <p>Hi! My name is Kabir Kathuria, and I am a dedicated and innovative student at Northeastern University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Business Administration with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. With a strong academic background, I thrive in both technical and analytical domains.</p>
        
        <h3>Academic Background</h3>
        <p>I am a candidate for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Business Administration with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University, expecting to graduate in May 2026. As a member of the Honors Program, I have maintained a 3.70 GPA, earned a spot on the Dean’s List multiple times, and received the Dean’s Scholarship. My coursework has given me a strong foundation in Object-Oriented Design, Algorithms and Data Structures, Software Engineering, Data Science, and Cybersecurity. With a blend of technical and business knowledge, I am passionate about leveraging AI and analytics to drive strategic decision-making.</p>

        <p>Beyond academics at Northeastern, I'm actively involved in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TAMID at Northeastern (TCF Instructor):</strong> Serving as a Software Consulting Foundations Instructor, teaching Git, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, and REST APIs.</li>
            <li><strong>Oasis at Northeastern (Software Developer):</strong> I worked as a software developer with a team of other developers to build an application involving our interests in basketball and incorporating it into our app using Swift and APIs.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Honors Society (Member):</strong> I have connected with like-minded peers and participated in professional development opportunities to further explore my interests in business strategy and leadership.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        <p>I have a strong technical foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, R, JavaScript, and SQL, with experience in frameworks like React and tools like AWS, Jenkins, and Git. My expertise extends to data analysis and machine learning, where I have worked with libraries such as pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and Hugging Face to build and optimize AI-driven solutions. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with software development, automation, and cloud computing, enabling me to develop scalable and efficient applications.</p>
