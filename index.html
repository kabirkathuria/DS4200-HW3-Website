            <h1>Welcome to Kabir Kathuria's Personal Website!</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Kabir Kathuria, and I am a dedicated and innovative student at Northeastern University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Business Administration with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. With a strong academic background, I thrive in both technical and analytical domains. My experience spans software engineering, data science, and technology consulting, and I am proficient in various frameworks, including Java, Python, React, SQL, and cloud technologies like AWS SageMaker and EC2.</p>
            <p>I have demonstrated my problem-solving skills through various projects, including developing an iOS app for basketball statistics, an automated maze solver, and a movie recommendation engine. My work experience at MFS Investment Management, TAMID at Northeastern, and Unscrambl, Inc. has equipped me with hands-on knowledge in automation, machine learning, and software development. I am passionate about leveraging AI and data-driven solutions to drive efficiency and innovation.</p>
            <p>Beyond academics and technology, I have a diverse set of interests. I enjoy collecting fragrances, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, and engaging in competitive activities such as basketball, spikeball, and billiards. I am a big Philadelphia Eagles fan as well, and love to play fantasy football with my friends. My dynamic skill set and curiosity make me an adaptable and forward-thinking professional.</p>
